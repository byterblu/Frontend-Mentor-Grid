      <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,

      <p>  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the  free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12  weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <p>  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
        professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
        student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
        did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
        project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
        experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</p>
